= Winner Picker for JUG DA based on Akka
:icons: font
:source-highlighter: coderay

This is a simple Akka application that runs a virtual ball passing game.
Every Player is instantiated as an actor and throws a ball at some randomly
chosen other player (meaning: sends a 'ball thrown' message to another player
actor).

To have a little interactive feeling you should start a Scala REPL. To do this,
first start an interactive SBT session:
[source, bash]
----
projectDir$ ./activator
----

You will see something like this:
[source, bash]
----
[info] Loading project definition from <PROJECTDIR>/project
[info] Updating {file:<PROJECTDIR>/project/}jugda-akka-build...
[info] Done updating.
[info] Set current project to jugda-akka (in build file:<PROJECTDIR>)
>
----
Now start the REPL by typing `console`.
[source, bash]
----
> console
scala>
----
Now you can manually start the actor system and kick off a game :)
[source, scala]
